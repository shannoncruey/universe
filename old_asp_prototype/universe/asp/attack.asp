Attacking is based on weapon and shield ratings.  The players current level is a multiplier of the weapon and shield ratings.  For example, a l00ser with a level 1 and weapons at 100 cannot beat a level 15 with weapons at 10.  100 vs 150.  I will probably incorporate the dice rolling logic from RISK into the battle sequences.

this screen will show the stats on you the player, and the stats on the person you have chosen to attack.  It will display your total probability for success, and let you decide whether or not to proceed.

If you are destroyed in a battle, your ship and all it's cargo are dropped in space at the coords where you died.   Other objects that you own are set on a timer to be released.  You have to reclaim all of them before the timer elapses, or they become publicly available.  

In order to claim an object, you must be docked. (For now, docked is within 50 units of XYZ.)

Ships can be autopiloted, but if you are not in command of a ship and it is attacked, your current skill level does not factor in to the battle equation.
